<h2>hashCode() and equals() in Collections</h2>
<p>You are already familiar with the<strong> <code class="language-java">hashCode()</code></strong> and <strong><code class="language-java">equals()</code> </strong>methods and know why you need to override them in custom classes. Now it's time to learn about their role in classes based on hash tables. We will explore it with the example of <strong>HashMap</strong> and <strong>HashSet</strong>. Seeing how these classes behave if you don't override<strong> </strong><code class="language-java">hashCode()</code> and <code class="language-java">equals()</code> will help you understand why it is so important to do that.</p>
<h5 id="the-role-of-hashcode">The role of hashCode()</h5>
<p>Before we get down to business, let's create a class that we will use for further examples.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Person {
    private String name;

    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // getter and setter

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Person{" +
                "name='" + name + '\'' +
                '}';
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>It's pretty simple, with just one field, but that's enough for us. Now let's create a map and add an entry to it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">    Map&lt;Person, Integer&gt; map = new HashMap();
    map.put(new Person("James Gosling"), 1995);</code></pre>
<p>Do you remember how entries are recorded inside the map? This might refresh your memory:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="341" name="2.svg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/353f31ad-0b88-49fa-99fd-3de9f4d4f530/" width="500"/></p>
<p>If we suppose that <code class="language-java">new Person("James Gosling")</code> hash code is <code class="language-java">1010101010</code>, it will be located under bucket number 2. Now let's try to access the entry:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">    Map&lt;Person, Integer&gt; map = new HashMap();
    map.put(new Person("James Gosling"), 1995);

    System.out.println(map.get(new Person("James Gosling"))); // null</code></pre>
<p>If you don't override the <code class="language-java">hashCode()</code> in this operation, the <code class="language-java">System.identityHashCode(Object x)</code> method will be used by default which calculates the hash code based on the object identity (its physical address). In this case, each object will have a different hash code, even if two objects are logically equal. Since we searched the entry by the other object, the result is <code class="language-java">null</code>.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">The quality of the hash code calculation algorithm directly affects the correctness of the classes based on a hash table. In Java, we have the <code class="language-java">Objects.hash(Object... values)</code> static method which calculates the hash code based on object field values. IntelliJ IDEA uses exactly this method in the autogenerated <code class="language-java">hashCode()</code> method. A well-implemented algorithm reduces the number of collisions and a poorly implemented one increases it. For example, you can override <code class="language-java">hashCode()</code> so that it returns a constant value. In this case, all the elements will be stored in one bucket, depriving us of the most important property thanks to which HashMap is so efficient.</div><br/>
Now, let's see how HashSet will behave if we don't override the <code class="language-java">hashCode()</code> method. As you know, HashSet is a collection of unique elements but in this case, it won't behave as expected:

<p> </p>
<pre><code class="language-java">    Set&lt;Person&gt; set = new HashSet();
    set.add(new Person("James Gosling"));
    set.add(new Person("James Gosling"));

    System.out.println(set); // [Person{name='James Gosling'}, Person{name='James Gosling'}]</code></pre>
<p>This Set will store both elements since they have different hash codes and are considered different elements. However, overriding <code class="language-java">hashCode()</code> alone won't solve the issue: the <code class="language-java">equals()</code> method is just as important. You'll understand why in the next section. </p>
<h5 id="the-role-of-equals">The role of equals()</h5>
<p>Imagine we have the same <code class="language-java">Person</code> class including the overridden <code class="language-java">hashCode()</code> method and the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">    Map&lt;Person, Integer&gt; map = new HashMap();
    map.put(new Person("James Gosling"), 1995);

    System.out.println(map.get(new Person("James Gosling"))); // null
</code></pre>
<p>To understand what result you will get it is important to know what happens when you search for an entry. First, the hash code of the object is calculated to find out in which bucket the entry is located. Then a key with that hash code is searched in the corresponding bucket and, once found, it is checked for equality by the <code class="language-java">equals()</code> method.<br/>
In our case, when performing the <strong>get</strong> operation we will find the correct entry location but the result will be <code class="language-java">null</code> since <code class="language-java">equals()</code> checks objects by identity using the <code class="language-java">==</code> operator by default. In the case above, with both methods overridden, the result would be <code class="language-java">1995</code>. That's why it is so important to override this method as well.<br/>
Now, let's test the code from the previous section demonstrating the HashSet behavior with overridden <code class="language-java">hashCode()</code> and  <code class="language-java">equals()</code>  methods:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">    Set&lt;Person&gt; set = new HashSet();
    set.add(new Person("James Gosling"));
    set.add(new Person("James Gosling"));

    System.out.println(set); // [Person{name='James Gosling'}]</code></pre>
<p>Everything works fine and as expected. The application will print only one element since HashSet recognized the duplicate element.</p>
<h5 id="key-mutations">Key mutations</h5>
<p>Let's explore the issue we will face if the state of the object changes during the execution of the program. Consider this situation where <code class="language-java">hashcode()</code> and <code class="language-java">equals()</code> are overridden:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">    Person james = new Person("James Gosling");

    Map&lt;Person, Integer&gt; map = new HashMap();
    map.put(james, 1995);

    james.setName("J. Gosling");

    System.out.println(map.get(new Person("James Gosling"))); // null
    System.out.println(map.get(new Person("J. Gosling"))); // null</code></pre>
<p>As you know, by default, the hash code is calculated based on the object identity, but the overridden <code class="language-java">hashCode()</code> based on <code class="language-java">Objects.hash(Object... values)</code> calculates it using object field values. So, on the line 4 we add an entry that we assume is stored under bucket 2. In the next step, we change the <code class="language-java">name</code> field value, which should have another hash code and another bucket location, but the entry remains under the same old bucket.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="298" name="3.svg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/3881f2ee-99c0-41fb-9d60-ef039f3765dc/" width="600"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="298" name="1.svg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/19540088-36bf-49d5-b92f-40140d0fa74f/" width="600"/></p>
<p><br/>
On the last two lines, we are trying to access an entry but in both cases, the result is <code class="language-java">null</code>, and here is why. At first, searching by <br/>
<code class="language-java">new Person("James Gosling")</code> we find the correct bucket, but checking <code class="language-java">new Person("James Gosling").equals(new Person("J. Gosling"))</code> returns <code class="language-java">false</code>. On the next line, the hash code calculation returns the bucket number where we don't have anything stored.<br/>
This is why you should avoid changing the state of the object after you used it as a key, otherwise, you will lose access to the entry. This kind of situation is commonly referred to as a <strong>memory leak.</strong><br/>
We'd face a similar problem with HashSet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">    Person james = new Person("James Gosling");

    Set&lt;Person&gt; set = new HashSet();
    set.add(james);
        
    james.setName("J. Gosling");
    set.add(new Person("J. Gosling"));

    System.out.println(set); // [Person{name='J. Gosling'}, Person{name='J. Gosling'}]</code></pre>
<p>This code performs with the same issue as the previous example concerning a HashMap in this section. We will give you a chance to share your explanation in the comments. If you feel like you know the correct answer and want to share it with other learners, you are welcome to do so.</p>
