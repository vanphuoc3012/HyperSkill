<h5 id="description" style="text-align: center;">Description</h5>
<p>Have you ever had to use one of those 2000-plus page phone books full of all kinds of organizations and people's names printed in a small font in multiple columns on each page? Finding the information you need in such books can be an ordeal. As a matter of fact, searching through huge data sets may be a challenging task for a computer, too.</p>
<p>In this project, you will create a phone book; you will implement several sorting and searching algorithms and compare their efficiency in dealing with a big dataset. For this, you will need to download the file <a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/197761/directory.txt" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">directory.txt</a> that contains the phone numbers of over a million people in multiple cities.</p>
<h5 id="objectives" style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, you should implement the simplest possible search to find the numbers of a few people whose names are listed in the file <a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/197761/find.txt" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">find.txt</a>. The data is randomly sorted, so we should use a Linear Search to look through each of the directory entries until we find our target. While there may be faster ways to do this, avoid using optimizations like Maps in this stage - we'll get to optimizing in later stages.</p>
<p>It takes a time to find all the records from the big file. We recommend you manually test your program with the simplified data: <a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/210117/small_directory.txt" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">small_directory.txt</a> and <a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/210117/small_find.txt" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">small_find.txt</a>. However, to pass all the tests, you will have to work with the big files mentioned above.</p>
<p>Note how long it takes you to do this when using a linear search so that you can compare results with other search methods.</p>
<p>To measure the time difference, you can use <code class="java">System.currentTimeMillis()</code>.</p>
<p>Also notice that you don't need to read the file "directory.txt" again and again after each query. You should load all lines into memory and measure only the search process.</p>
<p>Your program should output a message to show it has started searching, followed by a message stating how many entries out of the total number of targets in find.txt you were able to find along with the time taken to search for those entries (see example below).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please, do not keep the downloaded files inside your project directory because the server can reject large files and you will see the message <strong>"Failed to post submission to the Hyperskill"</strong>.</p>

<h5 id="example" style="text-align: center;">Example</h5>
<p>Below is an example of how your output should look:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Start searching...
Found 500 / 500 entries. Time taken: 1 min. 56 sec. 328 ms.</code></pre>
